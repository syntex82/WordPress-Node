👋 Hey Product Hunt!

We're launching the first self-hosted CMS that comes with a complete advertising platform built-in.

**The Problem:**
- AdSense takes 32% of your revenue
- Account bans happen without warning
- Third-party ad scripts slow down your site
- You have no control over your monetization

**Our Solution:**
A WordPress alternative where you run your OWN ad network:

🎯 **For Publishers:**
- Create ad zones on your site
- Sell directly to advertisers
- Keep 100% of revenue
- No approval process, no waiting

💰 **For Monetization:**
- CPC and CPM campaigns
- Real-time bidding (RTB)
- Fraud detection to protect you and advertisers
- Analytics dashboard

🔒 **Self-Hosted Benefits:**
- Your server, your data
- No one can ban you
- Full control forever
- Open source

**The Math:**
If you make $10k/month in ads:
- AdSense: You keep $6,800 (Google takes $3,200)
- With us: You keep $10,000

That's $38,400/year difference.

We built this because we were tired of seeing creators give away their hard-earned money to Big Tech.

Try it free. Self-host it. Own your revenue.

🙏 Would love your feedback!

## First Comment (Maker Comment)

```
Hey everyone! 👋

Maker here. Let me share why we built this:

I ran a blog that made ~$4,000/month from AdSense. Sounds good, right?

Then I did the math:
- Google's cut: $1,280/month
- Annual loss: $15,360

That's a car. Every year. Going to Google.

So I asked: "What if I just... ran my own ads?"

Turns out, it's totally doable. The hard part was building the infrastructure:
- Payment processing
- Fraud detection
- Real-time bidding
- Campaign management

So I built it all into a CMS.

Now anyone can:
1. Self-host their blog
2. Create ad zones
3. Find advertisers directly
4. Get paid via Stripe
5. Keep 100%

No AdSense approval. No account bans. No 32% fee.

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀
