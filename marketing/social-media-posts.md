Google AdSense takes 32% of your ad revenue.

That's $3,200 out of every $10,000 you earn.

I built a self-hosted alternative where you keep 100%.

🧵 Here's how it works:

### Thread

1/ Most bloggers don't realize how much money they're losing to AdSense.

On $10k/month in ads, Google keeps $3,200.

That's $38,400/year going to a trillion-dollar company instead of your pocket.

2/ The solution? Run your own ad network.

It sounds complicated, but I built a platform that does it all:
- Advertisers pay YOU directly via Stripe
- Built-in fraud detection
- Real-time bidding
- Self-hosted = you own everything

3/ Here's what changes:

❌ AdSense: You earn $10k, keep $6,800
✅ Self-hosted: You earn $10k, keep $10,000

Same traffic. Same advertisers. $38k more per year.

4/ But wait, how do you get advertisers?

Simple: Direct sales.

Email 10 businesses in your niche:
"Hey, I get 50k monthly readers interested in [topic]. Want to advertise for $500/month?"

5/ The math works even with fewer advertisers:

5 advertisers × $500/month = $2,500/month
= $30,000/year (keeping 100%)

vs AdSense $2,500/month
= $20,400/year (after Google's cut)

You're ahead $9,600/year.

6/ Plus you get:
- No risk of random account bans
- Faster page loads (no third-party scripts)
- Better SEO (Core Web Vitals)
- Direct relationships with advertisers

Stop using AdSense.

Here's what they don't tell you:

• They take 32% of YOUR revenue
• They can ban you with no warning
• Their scripts slow down your site
• You have zero control

There's a better way 🧵
```

```
I made $0 from Google last month.

I made $4,200 from my own ad network.

Here's the difference:

Google: Takes 32%, can ban you anytime
Self-hosted: Keep 100%, you're in control

Same traffic. Different strategy.
```

```
Why are you still using AdSense in 2024?

✅ You can run your own ad network
✅ Keep 100% of revenue
✅ Get paid directly via Stripe
✅ No approval process
✅ No random bans

The tools exist. You're just leaving money on the table.

### Professional Angle
```
I stopped using Google AdSense 6 months ago.

Best business decision I've made.

Here's what happened:

Before: $8,000/month in ad revenue → $5,440 after Google's 32% cut
After: $8,000/month → $8,000 (I keep it all)

Annual difference: $30,720

The secret? I run my own ad platform now.

- Direct relationships with advertisers
- Stripe payments (instant, no NET-30)
- Full control over ad placement
- No fear of account suspension

The myth is that you need Google to monetize content.

The reality is that Google needs YOUR content more than you need them.

If you're a content creator doing $5k+/month in ads, DM me. 
I'll show you how to make the switch.
