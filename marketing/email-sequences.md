## Lead Magnet: "The AdSense Exit Guide"

### Welcome Email (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your AdSense Exit Guide is here 🚀

Hey {first_name},

Thanks for downloading the guide!

Before you dive in, here's the ONE stat that should make you uncomfortable:

**Google AdSense takes 32% of every dollar you earn.**

If you're making $5,000/month, that's $1,600/month going to Google.
That's $19,200/year you're giving away.

The guide I'm sending you shows exactly how to:
- Set up your own ad network (it's easier than you think)
- Find advertisers who'll pay you directly
- Keep 100% of your revenue

P.S. - I made the switch 8 months ago. Haven't looked back since.

### Pain Point Email (Day 2)

**Subject:** The email I hoped I'd never have to send...

{first_name},

I got this email from a creator last week:

> "My AdSense account was suspended for 'invalid click activity.' 
> I've been publishing for 4 years. I did nothing wrong.
> I lost $3,000/month in income overnight. 
> Google won't tell me what happened."

This happens more than you think.

And when it does, there's no phone number to call. No human to talk to.
Just an algorithm that decided your livelihood isn't worth investigating.

**This is why I built a self-hosted alternative.**

When you run your own ad platform:
- No one can ban you
- No mysterious "policy violations"
- You own the relationship with advertisers
- You control everything

The peace of mind alone is worth it.

### Social Proof Email (Day 4)

**Subject:** "I made an extra $2,400 last month"

{first_name},

Quick story from Sarah, a food blogger:

> "I was skeptical. Running my own ads sounded technical and scary.
>
> But I tried it anyway.
>
> Month 1: I reached out to 20 kitchen product companies.
> 3 said yes to $300/month each = $900/month
>
> Month 3: Word spread. I now have 8 advertisers.
> $2,400/month - and I keep ALL of it.
>
> With AdSense, I'd only see $1,632 of that.
> That's $768/month I was leaving on the table."

The best part? Her advertisers LOVE working directly with her.

No algorithms. No mystery. Just business.

### Objection Handler Email (Day 6)

**Subject:** "But I don't know how to find advertisers..."

{first_name},

This is the #1 concern I hear:

"I'm not a salesperson. How do I find advertisers?"

Here's the thing - it's WAY easier than you think.

**The Template That Works:**

Subject: Partnership opportunity - [Your Site Name]

Hi [Name],

I run [Your Site], a blog about [topic] with [X] monthly readers.

My audience is exactly who buys products like yours.

I'm offering a limited number of direct advertising spots:
- Sidebar banner: $300/month
- Newsletter mention: $200/month
- Sponsored post: $500 one-time

Interested in discussing?

[Your Name]

**Send this to 20 companies. 2-3 will say yes.**

That's $600-900/month to start.

And unlike AdSense, these become RELATIONSHIPS. They renew. They refer others.

### Urgency Email (Day 8)

**Subject:** Quick math on what you're losing

{first_name},

Let me show you something.

**If you make $3,000/month on AdSense:**
- Google takes: $960/month
- You keep: $2,040/month
- Annual loss: $11,520

**If you make $5,000/month on AdSense:**

Every month you wait is money you're giving away.

The platform is free to try. Self-hosted. You own everything.

### Final Email (Day 10)

**Subject:** Last call, {first_name}

This is my last email about this.

You have two choices:

**Option A:** Keep using AdSense
- Give away 32% forever
- Risk account suspension
- Slow site, hurt SEO
- Zero control

**Option B:** Run your own ad network
- Keep 100%
- No one can ban you
- Faster site, better SEO
- Direct advertiser relationships

I built the tool. It's free to start.

The only question is: how much longer will you pay the Google tax?
